# Backbone - Organization Structure API PHP Client

## Introduction

The Organization Structure API PHP Client enables you to work with the Organization Structure API.

This PHP package is generated by an API client generator.

## Prerequisites

## Installation

You can use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Follow the [installation instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) if you do not already have composer installed.

~~~~

In your PHP script, make sure you include the autoloader:

## Using the library

The library can be used to communicate with the Organization Structure Resource Server.
The Client includes functionalities for every endpoint defined in the openapi.json.
The Client also is auto generated with jane-php using an openapi.json file.

### Creating a client

~~~~ php
require 'path/to/vendor/autoload.php';

// Valid clientId, clientSecret and requested scopes
$clientId = '1234';
$clientSecret = 'abcd';
$oAuthScopes = ['project:get'];

$config['clientId'] = $clientId;
$config['clientSecret'] = $clientSecret;
$config['oAuthScopes'] = $oAuthScopes;

$factory = new ClientFactory($config);
$client = Client::createWithFactory($factory);
~~~~

### Example Endpoint: Get Project
~~~~ php
$projectId = "project_123";  // string

$response = $client->getProject($projectId);
$response; // project
